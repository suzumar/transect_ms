This repository contains discussion, analysis pipelines, files and scripts used in the preprint 

**"Cross-shore distribution of SAR11 suggests efficient removal by a hard-bottom subtidal community

> Throughout this documentation the names in the final publication are diffeent than those used in the analysis.  Rather than exchange all names we provide the correspondence between names that are:

> Since we do not keep the original paths in this distribution we add links to files necessary to reproduce our analysis whenever needed  
> We used different conda enviroments containing different packages so we will list the content of these environments. We also provide the system profile at some of the steps of the analysis
